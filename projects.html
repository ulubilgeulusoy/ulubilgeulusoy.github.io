          <strong>Summary:</strong> Capstone 3 was a demonstration project of HOME representing a scenario of a future deep 
          space habitat scheduled maintenance operation with humans and autonomous systems. Twenty-six individuals from six different 
          universities (UC Davis, CU Boulder, USC, CMU, GaTech, and Texas A&M) were involved in representing ten graduate-level projects to NASA Reviewers. 
          I took on the role of project integration lead for Capstone 3 where I mostly done project management but also included a technical demonstration from my PhD research.

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This experiment was conducted to verify and validate a construct 
        that quantifies human assistance to AI-based systems, which has not been investigated in the context of space operations.
        
        <br><strong>My role(s):</strong> I designed the experiment protocol and dealt with IRB submission, created the experiment layout, recruited and trained
        30+ participants, conducted the experiment, and analyzed the collected data. For this project, I developed a
        linear regression model for setting inclusion criteria for subject selection, created training protocols, 
        and implemented automated data collection methods using Python OpenCV library. 
        Additionally, I utilized prompt engineering techniques to initialize a large language model (ChatGPT) to act as mission control. 
        Finally, I utilized parametric and nonparametric statistics to show significant and non-significant relationships between the quantifiable data.
        
        <br><strong>Encountered Problem(s) &amp; Solution(s):</strong> I identified an issue with one of the data 
        collection methods where a trust survey was missing a response item for a subset of participants. To address this, 
        I performed a statistical analysis, demonstrating that the final trust ratings were not statistically significant 
        from the projected ratings. This validation enabled the use of the incomplete data set.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This project was among the first collaborative research efforts 
          to demonstrate how deep space maintenance operations can be conducted independently of Earth.

        <br><strong>My role(s):</strong> My administrative responsibilities included co-developing the 
        space habitat scheduled maintenance scenario, co-developing demonstration requirements,
        coordinating between project owners (students, scientists, and professors), 
        and integrating PhD and graduate-level projects to align with the scenario. 
        My technical responsibility was to demonstrate a bi-directional assistance framework betweens humans and an 
        AI-enable agents, with assistance quantified 
        by the types and lengths of messages exchanged. Especially, this work highlighted the effectiveness 
        of specific assistive actions (messages) from humans to the AI in the context of space habitat maintenance operations
        enhancing the AI's ability to provide better support.

        <br><strong>Encountered Problem(s) &amp; Solution(s):</strong> A capstone demonstration is typically regarded as a 
        presentation of a final product designed to address real-life disturbances. However, for fundamental research 
        projects focused on future deep space habitats, demonstrating a final product is challenging, as it is often years 
        from completion. To address this, I incorporated audience interaction from NASA reviewers, who introduced improvised 
        issues into the maintenance task. Using the findings from my dissertation work, I demonstrated how the human-AI team 
        collaborates to resolve proposed challenges by assisting each other.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> LPL members are primarily MS and BS students from USC who join to gain industry-like experience before graduation. Establishing review standards was essential in helping LPL members understand the effort involved in professional project development.</p>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This project was part of USC's Liquid Propulsion Lab's LOX-Kerosene rocket engine testing campaign, where I collaborated with two other graduate students to integrate the engine's igniter.</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> For this project, I was responsible for the mechanical integration of the 3D-printed igniter housing to the engine with bolts, as well as the electrical wiring of the ignition system (e-match) to the data acquisition (DAQ) box.</p>
        <p><strong>Encountered Problem(s) &amp; Solution(s):</strong> During static fire testing, the engine failed to ignite due to a timing error. We had to re-integrate a fresh igniter and housing within twenty minutes because of limited liquid oxygen (LOX), which was boiling off. Despite the time pressure and stress, my two teammates and I remained calm and successfully integrated the igniter within the required timeframe for another attempt. This time, the engine ignited successfully, although the test ultimately ended in engine failure.</p>
