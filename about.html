    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      My passion lies in enabling human spaceflight, not only to expand humanity within our solar system but ultimately to reach interstellar space. Throughout my life, I have made decisions about my education, projects, and career that align with this vision. Explore the map below to learn more about the cities that have shaped my path.

    <p class="subtitle">
      Outside of space research, I am a strong admirer of ancient history, especially that of the Mediterranean region. I enjoy reading science fiction and have listed some of my favorite books below. I am also a car enthusiast who enjoys rewatching episodes of Top Gear and The Grand Tour, and have retraced parts of their United States road trips. I still play basketball once a week and enjoy watching football matches of my favorite team, Galatasaray.

          A personal favorite for how it blends mathematics, uncertainty, and human choice into a fast-paced story.
          It captures the tension between prediction and free will in a way that sticks.
